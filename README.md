## üöß Malware Dev Techniques

This repository was created to house the code from my own attempts to learn and develop malware using various techniques. I'm doing this to learn more about evasion techniques, and also because it's fun!

Some techniques will be in C#, some are in C, and some are in both. If in C, it will be in a folder named `<TECHNIQUE_NAME>_C`. The majority of this will be written in C. 

There are prerequisites:
* C# and C knowledge (for C#, know how dynamic importing is done)
* How Windows manages virtual memory via pages and the permissions that go along with it
* Usage of DLLs and WinAPI within a Windows machine
* How security solutions actually detect malware (the basics of it at least)

Note that every single function can be found within Microsoft's documentation, which is actually really good and detailed for developers. The DLL used for any form of injection is located in `msg.dll`, and it just makes a small window pop-up. Shellcode for `calc.exe` is in `calc.bin` for any usage.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

I'm not using ground-breaking techniques here, and it's pretty obvious that all of these will get flagged by a security solution and deleted. Anyways, the code here is for **educational purposes** only, and I do not condone any illegal activity (basically you can't sue me).
