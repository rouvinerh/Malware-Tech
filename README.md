## üöß Malware Dev Techniques

This repository was created to house the code from my own attempts to learn and develop malware using various techniques. The main language I'll be using is C#, with some parts of it in C as well. 

I'm really just doing this to learn more about evasion techniques, and also because it's pretty fun!

Some techniques will be in C#, some are in C, and some are in both. It will be mainly C#, and if there's a version in C, it will also be included in a folder named `<TECHNIQUE_NAME>_C`.

There are prerequisites:
* C# and C knowledge
* How Windows manages virtual memory via pages and the permissions that go along with it
* Usage of DLLs and WinAPI within a Windows machine
* How security solutions actually detect malware (the basics of it at least)

Note that every single function can be found within Microsoft's documentation, which is actually really good and detailed for developers. The DLL used for any form of injection is located in `MessageDLL`, and it just makes a small window pop-up.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

I'm not using ground-breaking techniques here, and it's pretty obvious that all of these will get flagged by a security solution and deleted. Anyways, the code here is for **educational purposes** only, and I do not condone any illegal activity (basically you can't sue me).
