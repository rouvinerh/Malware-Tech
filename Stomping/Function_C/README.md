## Function Stomping

This method is similar to the popular module stomping, which is a method to prevent usage of `VirtualAlloc` and `VirtualAllocEx` WinAPI calls (since they are monitored closely).

This method is somewhat better than module stomping since it only overwrites **one function** from a loaded DLL. Module stomping on the other hand injects an entire DLL into a process's memory region.
