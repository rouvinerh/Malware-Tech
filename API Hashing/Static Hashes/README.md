# API Hashing

This method will avoid suspicious strings and the IAT of the compiled binary from having stuff that is flagged by security solutions.

What this program does is use string hashing to call `GetProcAddress` and `GetModuleHandle` to get the addresses of functions `CreateThread` and `VirtualAlloc` from `kernel32.dll` using Murmur hash.  

The end product is the binary producing a thread, detectable by placing a breakpoint:

For some reason, the `calc.exe` payload does not pop up. Will fix that next time, but the call to `CreateThread` works.
